</ol>

<p>a. Pre-Orders on or after August 01, 2014. By pre-ordering a SKULLY Device on or after August 01, 2014 you acknowledge and agree that you are contributing (i.e., making a donation) to a work in progress and not making a direct purchase. Your reward is the number of SKULLY Devices you pre-order. If SKULLY is unable to fulfill your reward, the parties agree that these Terms will apply (including the Dispute Resolution section below). SKULLY may cancel or refund your contribution at any time and for any reason, and if SKULLY does so, SKULLY is not required to fulfill the reward.</p>

<p>b. Ordering, Generally. SKULLY may make SKULLY Devices available for purchase through the Site. Any sale of SKULLY Devices through the Site or any element of the Service is subject to these Terms, to any Additional Terms, or to any applicable bill of sale or purchase agreement. You agree to pay any amounts and fees SKULLY may charge for your purchase of the SKULLY Device or any associated Apps (a “Payment”). Before you are required to make any Payment, you will have an opportunity to review and accept the amount that you will be charged for such Payment. All Payments are in U.S. Dollars and are non-refundable, except as otherwise provided for by these Terms or any Additional Terms that may apply. SKULLY may change the Payment required for any component of the Service, including by changing the price for each SKULLY Device, on a going-forward basis, at any time. SKULLY will charge the payment method you specify at the time of purchase. You authorize SKULLY to charge all sums described herein to such payment method. If you make any applicable Payment with a credit card, SKULLY may seek pre-authorization of your credit card account prior to your purchase to verify that the credit card is valid and has the necessary funds or credit available to cover your purchase.</p>

<li>MODIFICATIONS.</li>
</ol>

<p>SKULLY reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to add, remove, or modify features of the Service at any time for any reason without liability to you. SKULLY may change, modify, add, or remove portions of these Terms (including the Additional Terms) at any time by making such modified terms available to you on the SKULLY website or through an App, or both. If SKULLY materially modifies these Terms, it will make reasonable efforts to notify you of the change. For example, we may send a message to your email address, if we have one on file, or generate a pop-up or similar notification when you access the Service for the first time after such material changes are made. No modifications to these Terms will apply to any dispute between you and SKULLY that arose prior to the date of such modification. Your use of the Service after modifications to these Terms become effective constitutes your binding acceptance of such changes. If you are dissatisfied with the terms of these Terms, then you agree that your sole and exclusive remedy is to discontinue any use of the Service.</p>

<ol>
<li>INDEMNITY.</li>
</ol>

<p>You agree that you will be responsible for your use of the Service, and you agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless SKULLY and its officers, directors, employees, consultants, affiliates, subsidiaries and agents (collectively, the “SKULLY Entities”) from and against any and all claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses, including reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs, arising out of or in any way connected with (i) your access to, use of, or alleged use of the Service at any time; (ii) your violation of these Terms or any representation, warranty, or agreements referenced herein, or any applicable law or regulation; (iii) your violation of any third-party right, including without limitation any intellectual property right, publicity, confidentiality, property or privacy right; or (iv) any disputes or issues between you and any third party. SKULLY reserves the right, at our own expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise subject to indemnification by you (and without limiting your indemnification obligations with respect to such matter), and in such case, you agree to cooperate with SKULLY’s defense of such claim.</p>

<ol>
<li>WARRANTY DISCLAIMER.</li>
</ol>

<p>THE SERVICES AND ALL MATERIALS AND CONTENT AVAILABLE THROUGH THE SERVICE ARE PROVIDED “AS IS” AND ON AN “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OR CONDITION OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED. THE SKULLY ENTITIES SPECIFICALLY (BUT WITHOUT LIMITATION) DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, RELATING TO THE SERVICE AND ALL MATERIALS AND CONTENT AVAILABLE THROUGH THE SERVICE, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO (i) ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, QUIET ENJOYMENT, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT; AND (ii) ANY WARRANTIES ARISING OUT OF COURSE OF DEALING, USAGE, OR TRADE. THE SKULLY ENTITIES DO NOT WARRANT THAT THE SERVICE OR ANY PART THEREOF, OR ANY MATERIALS OR CONTENT OFFERED THROUGH THE SERVICE, WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, SECURE, OR FREE OF ERRORS, VIRUSES, OR OTHER HARMFUL COMPONENTS, AND DO NOT WARRANT THAT ANY OF THE FOREGOING WILL BE CORRECTED.</p>

<p>NO ADVICE OR INFORMATION, WHETHER ORAL OR WRITTEN, OBTAINED BY YOU FROM THE SERVICE OR ANY MATERIALS OR CONTENT AVAILABLE ON OR THROUGH THE SERVICE WILL CREATE ANY WARRANTY REGARDING THE SKULLY ENTITIES OR THE SERVICE THAT IS NOT EXPRESSLY STATED IN THESE TERMS. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE AND ANY MATERIALS OR CONTENT THROUGH THE SERVICE AND ANY ASSOCIATED SITES OR SERVICES IS AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION AND RISK.</p>

<p>SOME JURISDICTIONS MAY PROHIBIT A DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES AND YOU MAY HAVE OTHER RIGHTS THAT VARY FROM JURISDICTION TO JURISDICTION.</p>

<ol>
<li>LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.</li>
</ol>

<p>IN NO EVENT WILL THE SKULLY ENTITIES BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, GOODWILL, USE, DATA, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO YOUR ACCESS TO OR USE OF, OR YOUR INABILITY TO ACCESS OR USE, THE SERVICE OR ANY MATERIALS OR CONTENT ON THE SERVICE, WHETHER BASED ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), STATUTE OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER OR NOT THE SKULLY ENTITIES HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE.</p>

<p>YOU AGREE THAT THE AGGREGATE LIABILITY OF THE SKULLY ENTITIES TO YOU FOR ANY AND ALL CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF RELATING TO THE USE OF OR ANY INABILITY TO USE THE SERVICE (INCLUDING ANY MATERIALS OR CONTENT AVAILABLE THROUGH THE SERVICE) OR OTHERWISE UNDER THESE TERMS, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE, IS LIMITED TO THE GREATER OF (i) THE AMOUNTS YOU HAVE PAID TO SKULLY FOR ACCESS TO AND USE OF THE SERVICE IN THE 12 MONTHS PRIOR TO THE CLAIM OR (ii) $5.</p>

<p>SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES. ACCORDINGLY, THE ABOVE LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.</p>

<p>EACH PROVISION OF THESE TERMS THAT PROVIDES FOR A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY, DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES, OR EXCLUSION OF DAMAGES IS TO ALLOCATE THE RISKS UNDER THESE TERMS BETWEEN THE PARTIES. THIS ALLOCATION IS AN ESSENTIAL ELEMENT OF THE BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN THE PARTIES. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT SKULLY HAS OFFERED ITS SERVICE AND SKULLY DEVICES, SET ITS PRICES, AND ENTERED INTO THIS AGREEMENT IN RELIANCE UPON THE WARRANTY DISCLAIMERS AND THE LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY SET FORTH HEREIN, THAT THE WARRANTY DISCLAIMERS AND THE LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY SET FORTH HEREIN REFLECT A REASONABLE AND FAIR ALLOCATION OF RISK BETWEEN YOU AND SKULLY, AND THAT THE WARRANTY DISCLAIMERS AND THE LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY SET FORTH HEREIN FORM AN ESSENTIAL BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN YOU AND SKULLY.</p>

<p>EACH OF THESE PROVISIONS IS SEVERABLE AND INDEPENDENT OF ALL OTHER PROVISIONS OF THESE TERMS. THE LIMITATIONS IN THIS SECTION 16 WILL APPLY EVEN IF ANY LIMITED REMEDY FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.</p>

<ol>
<li>DISPUTE RESOLUTION.</li>
</ol>

<p>a. Generally. In the interest of resolving disputes between you and SKULLY in the most expedient and cost effective manner, you and SKULLY agree that any and all disputes arising out of or relating in any way with these Terms or your use of the Service shall be resolved by binding arbitration. Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, may allow for more limited discovery than in court, and can be subject to very limited review by courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. Our agreement to arbitrate disputes includes, but is not limited to all claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of these Terms or the Service, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory, and regardless of whether the claims arise during or after the termination of these Terms. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND SKULLY ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION. Regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to your use of the Services or under these Terms must be filed by either party within two (2) years after such claim or cause of action arose or it will be forever barred.</p>

<p>b. Exceptions. Notwithstanding subsection 13.a, we both agree that nothing herein shall be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit either of our rights to (i) bring an individual action in small claims court, (ii) pursue enforcement actions through applicable federal, state, or local agencies where such actions are available, (iii) seek injunctive relief in a court of law, or (iv) to file suit in a court of law to address intellectual property infringement claims.</p>

<p>c. Arbitrator. Any arbitration between you and SKULLY will be governed by the Commercial Dispute Resolution Procedures and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, “AAA Rules”) of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”), as modified by these Terms, and will be administered by the AAA. The AAA Rules and filing forms are available online at www.adr.org, by calling the AAA at 1–800–778–7879, or by contacting SKULLY.</p>

<p>d. Notice; Process. A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other, by certified mail or Federal Express (signature required), or in the event that we do not have a physical address on file for you, by electronic mail (“Notice”). The Notice must (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (b) set forth the specific relief sought (“Demand”). We agree to use good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but If we do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or SKULLY may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or SKULLY shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any; provided that if our dispute is finally resolved through arbitration in your favor, SKULLY shall pay you the greater of (i) the amount awarded by the arbitrator, if any; (ii) the greatest amount offered by SKULLY in settlement of the dispute prior to the arbitrator’s award; or (iii) $1,000.00.</p>

<p>e. Fees. In the event that you commence arbitration in accordance with these Terms, SKULLY will reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for greater than $10,000, in which case the payment of any fees shall be decided by the AAA Rules. Any arbitration hearings will take place at a location to be agreed upon in San Francisco, California, provided that if the claim is for $10,000 or less, the party requesting relief may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted through binding non-appearance-based arbitration. This non-appearance-based arbitration must comply with the following rules: (a) the arbitration shall be conducted by telephone, online, and/or be solely based on written submissions (the specific manner shall be chosen by the party initiating the arbitration); (b) the arbitration shall not involve any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless otherwise mutually agreed by the parties; and (c) any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator shall be final and may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. If the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. In such case, you agree to reimburse SKULLY for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based. The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits.</p>

<p>f. No Class Actions. YOU AND SKULLY AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and SKULLY agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.</p>

<p>g. Enforceability. If only Subsection 13.f of this Section 13 or the entirety of this Section 16 is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this Section 13 shall be null and void and, in such case, the parties agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section 18 shall govern any action arising out of or related to these Terms.</p>

<ol>
<li>MISCELLANEOUS.</li>
</ol>

<p>a. Governing Law. These Terms, whether interpreted in a court of law or in arbitration, shall be governed by the laws of the State of California as they apply to agreements entered into and to be performed entirely within California by California residents regardless of your country of origin or where you access the Services, and without regard to conflict of law principles or the United Nations Convention for the International Sale of Goods.</p>

<p>b. Jurisdiction and Venue. To the extent that any lawsuit or court proceeding is permitted hereunder, you and SKULLY agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the state courts and federal courts located within San Francisco, California for the purpose of litigating all such claims or disputes.</p>

<p>c. Entire Agreement. These Terms (including the various additional terms incorporated herein by reference) constitute the entire agreement between you and SKULLY, and supersedes any and all prior agreements, negotiations, or other communications between you and SKULLY, whether oral or written, with respect to the subject matter hereof, and, except as expressly provided herein, cannot be modified except in writing signed by both parties.</p>

<p>d. Severability. In the event that any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, then: (a) such provision shall be deemed reformed to the extent strictly necessary to render such provision valid and enforceable, or if not capable of such reformation shall be deemed severed from these Terms; and (b) the validity and enforceability of all of the other provisions hereof, shall in no way be affected or impaired thereby.</p>

<p>e. Compliance with Laws. You agree to abide by all applicable laws in your use of the Service, including export control laws and similar regulations governing the transfer of software and other technology outside of the United States or other jurisdictions.</p>

<p>f. Assignment. You may not assign these Terms without the prior written consent of SKULLY, whether expressly or by operation of law, including in connection with a merger or change of control, and any such attempted assignment shall be void and of no effect. SKULLY may assign these Terms without restriction. Subject to the foregoing, these Terms shall be binding on the parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns.</p>

<p>g. Force Majeure. You acknowledge and understand that if SKULLY is unable to provide the Service as a result of a force majeure event SKULLY will not be in breach of these Terms. A force majeure event means any event beyond the control of SKULLY.</p>

<p>h. Waiver. The failure to exercise, or delay in exercising, a right, power or remedy provided in these Terms or by law shall not constitute a waiver of that right, power or remedy. SKULLY’s waiver of any obligation or breach of these Terms shall not operate as a waiver of any other obligation or subsequent breach of these Terms.</p>

<p>i. Consent to Electronic Communications. By using the Service, you consent to receiving certain electronic communications from us as further described in our Privacy Policy. Please read our Privacy Policy to learn more about your choices regarding our electronic communications practices. You agree that any notices, agreements, disclosures, or other communications that we send to you electronically will satisfy any legal communication requirements, including that such communications be in writing.</p>

<p>j. Export. The SKULLY Device and Service may be subject to United States export controls. You may not export or re-export a SKULLY Device or any element of the Service without: (a) the prior written consent of SKULLY, (b) complying with any applicable export control laws, and (c) obtaining all appropriate permits and licenses. In any event, you may not transfer or authorize the transfer of the SKULLY Device to a prohibited territory, country or organization (currently including, without limitation Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Libya, North Korea, Sudan and Syria and any organization named on the United States’ Commerce Department’s “Denied Parties List”) or otherwise in violation of any applicable restrictions or regulations. You understand and agree that the SKULLY Device and Service may contain information that is controlled and restricted from export by United States export controls (the “Controlled Information”). If SKULLY, in its sole discretion, determines that it cannot implement the Service in a manner to exclude access to Controlled Information where required, if you are in a country or territory that is subject to such regulation, you shall not be provided access to the Service.</p>
