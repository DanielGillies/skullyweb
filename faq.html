                                            The SKULLY AR-1 is an intermediate oval head form and comes in sizes between Small and XXL. The fit shape is similar to a Shoei RF-1200 (see sizing chart below). AR-1 is a race fit (snug), so order 1 size larger for a street fit. As part of our commitment to customer satisfaction, if you find the fit is a bit too large or small, we will send you one additional premium padding set free of charge to get the perfect fit.

ECE is the racing standard for AMA, World SBK, and MotoGP, as well as the largest number of independent racing organizations worldwide. DOT/ECE as a joint standard is one of the most stringent testing standards worldwide.

We did not pursue SNELL approval because it does not grant us any additional homologation. ECE is the racing standard for AMA, World SBK, and MotoGP, as well as the largest number of independent racing organizations worldwide. SNELL is a stand-in certification that allows non-ECE compliant helmets onto ECE racetracks. Further, DOT/ECE as a joint standard is one of the most stringent testing standards worldwide, and includes most of the tests that SNELL requires, but often to a greater extent and with lower energy transfer to the head. SNELL helmets are associated with a higher rate of concussion/TBI in average crash scenarios than DOT/ECE helmets. We want to make sure that we are protecting your brain for the largest majority of scenarios, rather than making sure that it can absorb impacts that would leave the rest of you paralyzed.</p>

It appears to be about the size of the rider’s outstretched hand. This means you can see the road ahead without any obstruction from the display. This display system simplifies the riding experience because you no longer need to take your eyes off the road to see what is around you or to find your route. With our optical technology, the display is always in focus no matter where you look, allowing instant comprehension of the information.
