                                                The SKULLY AR-1 is available in sizes S-XXL. To determine your size, please use the SKULLY Fit Guide below. The AR-1’s overall shape is similar to the Shoei RF-1200. If you know that you wear a size L Shoei helmet, we recommend ordering your SKULLY AR-1 one size larger because it is close-fitting. We will send you one additional premium padding set free of charge if your helmet feels slightly loose.

The ECE is the standard safety certification for the American Motorcycle Association, World Superbike Championship, MotoGP™, as well as the majority of independent racing organizations worldwide. With both DOT and ECE certifications, the SKULLY AR-1 has passed the toughest testing standards that exist for motorcycle helmets. </p>
                                            <p class="black"><strong>What about Snell certification?</strong> ECE testing, the most rigorous and up-to-date standard in the world, is a combination of both DOT and Snell testing procedures. The ECE standard is also recognized by over 50 countries. We chose this route because ECE has a few extra tests added in, and we want to make sure the SKULLY AR-1 protects your noggin (and brain) for as many crash scenarios as possible. Research has shown that Snell helmets are associated with a higher rate of concussion and Traumatic Brain Injury in average crash scenarios compared to DOT/ECE helmets.</p>

If you know the capacity of your gas tank and MPG, you can program your motorcycle’s fuel gage information into the AR-1 using the <a href="home-app-landing.html">SKULLY app.</a> For future partnership and compatibility information, please <a href="index.html#signup">join #SKULLYNation</a> for a monthly email update.
